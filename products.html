        <h2 id="product_1">Optollution</h2>
        <p id="product_1A">Optollution is the name of the glasses we created that helps visualize the effects of pollution wherever you are located. These glasses will have special lenses in them that will change color based on the levels of pollution in the air and they will also be connected to an app on your phone that will show you what toxins are in the air and the danger levels. So, if your glasses suddenly change color you can check the Optollution app on your phone to see what pollutants are in the air.</p>

        <h2 id="product_2">Conneclaces</h2>
        <p id="product_2A">Coneclaces is another product that we created. These necklaces look like any normal necklaces. But these will change color acording to the qualiry of the air. We believe these will help you to be aware of the air quality and as well look good with these Conneclaces</p>
